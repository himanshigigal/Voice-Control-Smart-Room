# Voice-Control-Smart-Room
This project enables voice control of electrical appliances like lights or fans using Python's speech recognition and an Arduino UNO with a servo motor. Voice commands such as “Turn on the light” or “Turn off the light” trigger the servo to press a physical switch, making the room smarter without using smart home devices.
